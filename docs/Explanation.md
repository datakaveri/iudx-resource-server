# Tokens, Users and Roles
## Tokens used in DX
- Tokens for a user could be created using DX AAA Server API : [link to the API docs](https://authorization.iudx.org.in/apis#tag/Token-APIs/operation/post-auth-v1-token). The token used in DX are :

| Token             |                                                                                     Purpose                                                                                     | Users                                                                      |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DX Identity token |                                             Serves as an identifier of the user to the server to access the DX server capabilities                                              | Provider, provider delegate, consumer, consumer delegate, cos admin, admin |
| Keycloak token    | Access token as bearer credential is generated by Keycloak by providing the client's email ID and password and then adding bearer to the access token : `bearer <access-token>` | DX AAA Server, Users                                                       |
| Access token      |                                                                    To get access to resource, resource group                                                                    | Provider, provider delegate, consumer, consumer delegate                   |

## Tokens accepted in DX Resource Server

##### Access Policy
- secure - secure access policy represents that the resource on which request is made is secure, so it will have some associated constraints.
- open - open access policy represents that the resource on which request is made is open, its don't have associated constraints.

Tokens accepted by the DX Resource Server are the DX Identity token and access token(open/secure). Identity token is used for user specific APIs whereas the bearer token is used for the Verify API.
Providers, Consumers and delegates of providers and consumers are allowed to access the following APIs using the mentioned token:

| API                           |                              Users                              |
|:------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Search APIs (open resource)   | admin, provider, provider delegate, consumer, consumer delegate |
| Search APIs (secure resource) |    consumer, consumer delegate, provider delegate, provider     |
| Async APIs  (secure resource) |    consumer, consumer delegate, provider delegate, provider     |
| Async APIs  (open resource)   | admin, provider, provider delegate, consumer, consumer delegate |
| Metering Apis                 | admin, provider, provider delegate, consumer, consumer delegate |
| Subscription API              |                   consumer, consumer delegate                   |
| Adaptor Api                   |                   provider, provider delegate                   |
| Management API                |                   Consumer, consumer delegate                   |

## Users and Roles
All registered users of DX can access the DX Resource Server. The DX Resource Server identifies the user based on the token information which is provided by DX AAA Server.

How is the user considered as a consumer, provider or delegate?
- While decoding the token at the DX Resource Server, the **role** in token fetched from DX AAA Server and then the following rules is applied to identify the user
  - A user is considered as a **provider** if **role** is **provider** 
  - A user is considered as a **consumer** if **role** is **consumer** 
  - A user is considered as a delegate of the consumer if **role** is **delegate** and **drl** is **consumer**
  - A user is considered as a delegate of the provider if **role** is **delegate** and **drl** is **provider**

## Terminologies and Definitions
- **Access Token** : Access Token in resource server is Open and Secure tokens.
- **Delegate** : Consumer or provider appointed user who could act on behalf of the delegator
